# This is a simple TODO list which may best be viewed and edited with
# the 'tasks' plugin of the 'Atom' cross-platform text editor.
#
# Just make sure you set the following custom settings, either in the UI
# under tasks plugin preferences:=
#
# tasks: (or under 'editor:' in 'config.cson')
#  baseMarker: "-"
#  cancelledMarker: "-"
#  completeMarker: "-"
# -------------------------------
# You may also use the 'PlainTasks' plugin of SublimeText (again with similar
# customs settings that enable YAML compatibility...
#
# in your User's PlainTasks.sublime-settings:=
# {
#  "open_tasks_bullet": "-", // options: - | ❍ | ❑ | ■ | □ | ☐ | ▪ | ▫ | – | — | ≡ | → | › | [ ]
#  "done_tasks_bullet": "-", // options: + | ✓ | ✔ | √ | [x]
#  "cancelled_tasks_bullet": "-", // options: x | ✘ | [-]
# }
# -------------------------------
# The structure is in fact a YAML-compatible variation of the popular
# '.todo' file format (introduced by the 'TaskPaper' application).
#
# TaskPaper should still be able to read the file, but "saving" from
# TaskPaper will currently break YAML compatibility (by emitting tab characters
# for indentation, instead of the spaces expected by YAML)
