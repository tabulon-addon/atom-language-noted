# More TODO support in Atom

 Just like 'language-todo' and co, it allows constructs like @TODO, @HACK, @OMG to be highlighted; but instead of those words being hard-coded into the mini-language, they are jotted down with a simple light-weight markup syntax that also carries info about the 'spirit'
 of the tag (i.e. how it makes you feel:-). For example : @@TODO, !@ATTENTION, -@OMG, *@HACKED.

Vaguely based on [language-todo] and also borrowed some ideas from [language-todo-more-words] [language-todo-extra-words]. Those all appear to have some things in common in any case.

Contributions are greatly appreciated; but will only be handled as my schedule permits.
Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
