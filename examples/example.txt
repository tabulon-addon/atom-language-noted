  !@NOTE: As you can see, plain text is also subject to "language-noted".
  Granted, this may or may not be desirable; but alas there is no way to
  turn it on or of for the moment.

  the hash signs leading the lines below are insignificant for the [language-noted] grammar.
  All that matters is what the source language considers as a valid comment or what atom considers as plain text.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Below are a bunch of tokens for a quick reference and also a brief visual test for [language-noted].
#
# "language-noted" is a grammar package which helps highlighting specially marked up stuff in comments.
# It has the same purpose (but not the same approach) as [language-TODO] and its derivatives that employ
# a hard coded list of words to highlight.
#
# "language-noted", on the other hand, takes a different approach
# by letting the comment author choose the 'spirit' in which that particlar word will be styled, with the help
# of an extremely simple markup syntax as shown below:
#
#   @NONE ~@AUTHOR @@NEUTRAL :@EAGER ,@BLAND ;@DULL &@VERBOSE +@GOOD ?@QUESTION  >@PERTINENT !@ALERT *@FISHY -@BAD %@SHAKY _@SPOOKY
#   #NONE ~#AUTHOR ##NEUTRAL :@EAGER ,@BLAND ;@DULL &@VERBOSE +#GOOD ?#QUESTION  >#PERTINENT !#ALERT *#FISHY -#BAD %#SHAKY _#SPOOKY
#   RADAR:  <radar://issue/124> (radar links are always rendered the same as >@PERTINENT)
